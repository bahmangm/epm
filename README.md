A new method to find exact matching patterns in a corpus.

When I was studying [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200912) which proposes an interesting and effective method to improve time and memory complexity of exact pattern matching by splitting the pattern into two equal parts, I was encouraged to think about more enhancing its effeciency.

The change that I proposed to [Prof. Saqib Hakak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=_16fHwIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate#) did not have a positive impact on the results, but it might be proper in other projects.
